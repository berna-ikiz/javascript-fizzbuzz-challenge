# FizzBuzz Challenge

## What is this?

This is a simple challenge where you need to create a function that does the following for numbers from 1 to 100:

- If the number is divisible by **3**, print `"Fizz"`.
- If the number is divisible by **5**, print `"Buzz"`.
- If the number is divisible by **both 3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`.

Use a loop and the modulo (`%`) operator to check if a number is divisible.
